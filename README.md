 On Landing home page you will view  some products and add some items to cart.

 And on cart screen you will see items added to cart with billing information.

 I have implemented redux tookit and redux persist in this project.

 on Page refresh products in the cart will not disappear as i have impelemented redux-persist to persist data.
